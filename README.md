Web Portal on Public Grievances

In this project i made a web portal on public grievances through which we can register a complaint with type of public/pension and can later see the status of our complaint. This is done using the individual registration of a person through the new registration link and can do login using his registered email as username and mobileNo. as password. When a person logins into the portal a new session of him/her get starts where he/she can file a complaint and view status of his previous complaints. When the person do logout the session get ends and main page having signin/signup will get loaded.
